# WebPay NFC
A low-cost, web-based contactless payment solution for small businesses in Germany.

---

## Problem Statement
Many small shopkeepers and local vendors in Germany still rely primarily on cash transactions.  
This is mainly due to the **high setup and transaction fees** of traditional POS (Point of Sale) machines and the **complex registration processes** involved.  
As a result, customers who prefer digital or contactless payments often face inconvenience, and merchants lose potential sales opportunities.

## Proposed Solution
The project **WebPay NFC** aims to develop a **web-based platform** that enables small businesses to accept **contactless (NFC) card payments** without the need for a physical POS terminal.  

Merchants can process payments directly through their **smartphone or computer’s web browser** using built-in or external NFC readers.  
Payments are securely handled via **trusted gateways** like **Stripe Terminal**, **SumUp**, or **Adyen Tap-to-Pay**, while transaction details are stored safely in a database.

This solution is designed to be:
- **Low-cost** – no expensive POS hardware required  
- **Secure** – uses encrypted payment APIs  
- **Efficient** – supports instant, contactless transactions  
- **Accessible** – built as a simple, browser-based application
